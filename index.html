        <h1>Gelatin Photoblog</h1>
        <p>I am sorry to say that &mdash; after 12 years &mdash; the photoblog has siezed to exist. I will provide an archived gallery of the pictures soon and have explained the reasons behind my decesion in <a href="//borbely.info/blog/goodbye-gelatin-photoblog">this article</a>.</p>
        <!-- <p>If you just want to find the pictures, which were hosted here, you can still find them in these <a href="//borbely.info/galleries/">archived galleries</a>.</p> -->

        <p>Thank you for your visit!</p>
